You are an expert reasoning graph architect. Given a problem and step-by-step solution, identify **direct dependencies** between steps using this format:

### Rules:
1. **Direct Use Only**:  
   Include step `i` in step `t`'s dependencies **only if** step `t` explicitly uses the result, lemma, or output from step `i`. Ignore indirect dependencies.

2. **Minimal & Non-Redundant**:  
   - If step `t` uses identical information from multiple steps (e.g., the same lemma), include **only the earliest step** (smallest index).  
   - The set must be the **minimal** required to verify step `t`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - For each step `t`:
     - Identify ALL used result, lemma, or output with `<expression>...</expression>`
     - Specify source step with `<step>...</step>`

### Example:
Problem: Find circle area with radius 5  
Steps:  
[0] Recall formula: Area = π * r²  
[1] Plug in radius: Area = π * 5²  
[2] Calculate 5²: 25  
[3] Multiply: Area = 25π  

Analysis:  
- Step 0: Only states the area formula, so no dependencies. 
- Step 1: Plug radius in <expression>Area = π * r²</expression> from <step>0</step>.
- Step 2: Calculate <expression>5²</expression> from <step>1</step>.
- Step 3: Plug <expression>5² = 25</expression> from <step>2</step> in <expression>Area = π * 5²</expression> from <step>1</step>.

### Your Task:
Analyze this problem and return analysis using EXACTLY the format that satisfy the rules above:
- Step 0: ...
- Step 1: ...
