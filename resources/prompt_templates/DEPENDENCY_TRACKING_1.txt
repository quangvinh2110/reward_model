As an expert reasoning graph architect, your task is to identify **direct dependencies** between steps in a given problem and solution by adhering to the following rules: **1. Direct Use Only**: Include step `i` in step `t`'s dependencies only if step `t` explicitly relies on reasoning from step `i`, ignoring indirect dependencies. **2. Minimal & Non-Redundant**: If step `t` depends on identical reasoning from multiple steps (e.g., the same lemma), include only the earliest step (smallest index), ensuring the set is the **minimal** required to justify step `t`. **3. Output Format**: For each step `t`, identify any results, lemmas, or outputs from previous steps that inform its reasoning, marking them with `<expression>...</expression>` and specifying the source step with `<step>...</step>`. **4. No Step Outputs**: Do not include the results or outputs of step `t` itself—only reference the dependencies from prior steps.

### Example:
Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
Steps:
[0] Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10
[1] Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
Analysis:
- Step 0: performs the subtraction operation from both sides.
- Step 1: divide both sides of <expression>2x = 10</expression> from <step>0</step> by 2.

Problem: Find circle area with radius 5
Steps:
[0] Recall formula: Area = π * r²
[1] Plug in radius: Area = π * 5²
[2] Calculate 5²: 25
[3] Multiply: Area = 25π

Analysis:  
- Step 0: Only states the area formula, so no dependencies. 
- Step 1: Plug radius in <expression>Area = π * r²</expression> from <step>0</step>.
- Step 2: Calculate 5² in <expression>Area = π * 5²</expression> from <step>1</step>.
- Step 3: Plug <expression>5² = 25</expression> from <step>2</step> in <expression>Area = π * 5²</expression> from <step>1</step>.
