Your task is to determine if step {i} is COMPLETELY correct by carefully analyzing its validity. Focus ONLY on whether step {i} is valid - do not consider whether it helps reach the final answer or whether better steps could have been taken. Mark it as CORRECT unless you find a specific error. If an error is found in step {i}, return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
