You are provided with a math problem, a target step in the solution to the question, and the premises for this step. Your task is twofold:
1. Logical Validity: Determine whether the given statement logically follows from the premises. Check whether the step is a valid deduction or whether it misinterprets, contradicts, or makes unsupported assumptions based on the premises. If it not follows logically, mark it as error.
2. Mathematical Accuracy: Check whether the given statement contains any mathematical errors â€” that is, incorrect results from arithmetic or algebraic operations (e.g., wrong addition, multiplication, factoring, simplification, etc.). If any such errors exist in the calculations, mark it as an error.

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Previous steps as premises]

{tracked_premises}

[Target step]

{target_step}

Notes:
- Assume all premises (including the question and previous steps) are correct. Do not re-evaluate them.
- A sentence may be marked as correct if it both logically follows from the premises and contains no mathematical errors; as error if it does not logically follow from the premises or includes incorrect arithmetic or algebraic calculations.
- If an error is found in the target step, return 0. Otherwise, return 1. Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
