The following is a math problem and a (partial) solution (split into steps, enclosed with tags, and indexed from 0). The solution may be partial or complete:

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Solution]

{tagged_steps}

Use the problem statement and given steps as context, your task is to review and critique **ONLY** step {idx}. You must reason and explain clearly BEFORE go to your final answer. Do NOT directly skip to the conclusion or provide your final answer before reasoning. If an error is found in step {idx}, return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
