You are provided with a math problem, a group of indexed steps from a solution, and a target step within that group. Your task is twofold:
1. Logical Validity: Determine whether the target step logically follows from the problem and from prior steps in the group. Check whether the step is a valid deduction or whether it misinterprets, contradicts, or makes unsupported assumptions. If it not follows logically, mark it as error.
2. Mathematical Accuracy: Check whether the given statement contains any mathematical errors â€” that is, incorrect results from arithmetic or algebraic operations (e.g., wrong addition, multiplication, factoring, simplification, etc.). If any such errors exist in the calculations, mark it as an error.

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Group of steps]

{tagged_steps}

[Target step]

{target_step}

Notes:
- Assume all other steps (except the target, including the question) are correct. Do not re-evaluate them.
- A sentence may be marked as correct if it both logically follows from the premises and contains no mathematical errors; as error if it does not logically follow from the problem and prior steps or includes incorrect arithmetic or algebraic calculations.
- If an error is found in the target step, return 0. Otherwise, return 1. Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
