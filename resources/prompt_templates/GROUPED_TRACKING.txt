You are an expert in mathematical logic and reasoning. You are given a math problem and a partial (or sometimes complete) solution consisting of a set of indexed steps. Your task is to analyze each step in the provided set and identify all the direct premises from the set it depends on.

### Definitions

- **Premise:** Step A is a premise for Step B if Step B uses any fact, object, or conclusion derived in Step A. Premises must be steps that precede the current step within the provided set.
- **Resolved:** A step is "resolved" if all its necessary premises are present within the provided set of solution steps. Since the solution maybe partial, some steps may remain unresolved due to missing premises outside the given steps.

### Task

1. Briefly explain which parts in prior steps they rely on, and whether these premises are enough.
2. Based on your explanation, generate a JSON object that strictly adheres to the following format:
```json
{{
  <index>: {{"premises": [<list of premise indices>], "resolved": <boolean>}},
  ...
}}
```
Example JSON object: ```json
{{
  "5": {{"premises": [], "resolved": false}},
  "6": {{"premises": [5], "resolved": true}},
  "7": {{"premises": [6], "resolved": false}},
  "8": {{"premises": [5, 6], "resolved": true}}
}}
```
