The following is a math problem and a solution (split into steps, enclosed with tags, and indexed from 0). The solution may be partial or complete:

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Solution]

{tagged_solution}

Your task is to review and critique only step {i}, considering the context of the math problem and all prior steps. Evaluate step {i} for correctness based on its intended purpose within the solution, whether the solution is partial or complete. If an error is found in step {i}, return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
