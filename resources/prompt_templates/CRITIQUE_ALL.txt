The following is a math problem and a solution (split into steps, enclosed with tags and indexed from 0):

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Solution]

{tagged_steps}

Your task is to review and critique the solution step by step. Once you identify an error in a step, return the index of the step where the earliest error occurs. Otherwise, return the index of -1 (which typically denotes "not found").

Please put your final answer (i.e., the index) in \boxed{{}}.
