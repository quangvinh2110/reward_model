### **Overview:**  
You are an expert in mathematical logic and reasoning. You will be given a math problem and a partial solution consisting of a set of indexed steps. Your task is to analyze each step in the provided set and: (1) Identify **only the direct premises** it depends on; and (2) Determine whether the step is **resolved**.  

### **Definitions:**  
- **Direct Premise:** A step's *direct premise* is an earlier step whose **concluding expression or result** serves as the **immediate object of transformation** in the target step. The target step acts directly upon the output of its direct premise.  
- **Resolved:** A step is *resolved* if **all** its direct premises are included in the provided solution set. If any direct premise is missing, the step is *unresolved*.  

### **Instruction: How to Analyze Each Step**  
Your analysis must strictly follow this process. Do **not** re-derive or re-prove the target step. 
1. **Identify the Core Action:** Determine the target step's primary mathematical operation (e.g., substitution, simplification, applying a rule, algebraic manipulation).  
2. **Isolate the Active Input:** Pinpoint the specific expression, equation, or value that the action is performed **on**. This is the material being directly transformed.  
3. **Trace the Input to its Source:** Locate the preceding step where this active input was the final conclusion. This source step is the direct premise.  

### **Guiding Principle:**  
A direct premise provides the **triggering result** for the target step's action. Distinguish this from "background context." For example, if a step substitutes `y = 3`, its direct premise is the step that concluded `y = 3`, **not** an earlier step that introduced the variable `y`.  

### **Task:**  
1. For each step, briefly explain your reasoning by stating the core action and tracing its active input(s) to their source step(s).
2. Generate a JSON object adhering to this format:  
   ```json
   {
     "<index>": {"premises": [<list of premise indices>], "resolved": <boolean>},
     ...
   }
   ```
   **Example:**  
   ```json
   {
     "5": {"premises": [], "resolved": false},
     "6": {"premises": [5], "resolved": true},
     "7": {"premises": [6], "resolved": false},
     "8": {"premises": [5, 6], "resolved": true}
   }
   ```
