The following is a math problem and a solution (split into steps, enclosed with tags, and indexed from 0). The solution may be partial or complete:

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Solution]

{tagged_steps}

Your task is to review and critique only the last step, considering the context of the math problem and all prior steps. Evaluate the last step for correctness based on its intended purpose within the solution, whether the solution is partial or complete. If an error is found in the last step, return 0. If the last step is true or neutral (i.e., not incorrect but not directly contributing to the solution), return 1.

Please put your final answer (i.e., 1 or 0) in \boxed{{}}.
