You are an expert in logical dependency analysis for step-by-step problem solving.

**Task: **
Given a problem statement, a current step t, and a window of k previous steps, identify the **direct dependencies** of step t by outputting the indexes of the previous steps that step t **explicitly and necessarily relies on**. Only include steps whose results or lemmas are directly used in step t such that, if those steps are correct, step t can be verified independently.

**Input Format:**
- **Problem:** [Problem description]
- **Previous Steps:**
  - [index-1] [Step description]
  . . .
  - [index-k] [Step description]
- **Current Step:**
  - [index-t] [Step description]

**Output Format:**
- Return a list [index1, index2,...] of step indexes (e.g., [2, 5]).
- **Only include steps directly referenced or required by step t.**
- If no dependencies exist, return [].
- Please put your final answer (i.e., the list) in \boxed{{}}.

**Guidelines:**
1. **Direct Dependencies Only:** Include a step only if step t explicitly uses its result, lemma, or intermediate value. Do **not** include steps that are indirectly related (e.g., earlier steps in a chain of reasoning not directly used in step t).
2. **Minimality:** The list should be the minimal set required to verify step t.
3. **Assume Correctness:** Assume all listed dependencies are correct; your task is to identify dependencies, not validate correctness.
4. **Earliest-Step Priority:** If multiple steps (e.g., step i and step j, where i < j) provide identical necessary information for step t, output only i (the earliest).


**Example:**
Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 4 = 12
Previous Steps:
[0] Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 8
[1] Divide both sides by 2: x = 4
Current Step: 
[2] Verify the solution by plugging x=4 into the original equation.
Output: \boxed{{[1]}} (Step 3 directly depends on Step 2â€™s result, x=4).
