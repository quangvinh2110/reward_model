You are given one reasoning step from a mathematical solution. Your job is to read exactly that step, ignore everything else, and pull out *only* the new fact(s), result(s), or object(s) that this step *adds* to the proof. We call each such new piece of information a **“derived statement.”** Don’t worry about labeling or classifying the derived statement—just list each one as a separate bullet point, in natural mathematical language.

A “derived statement” is any of:

* A numeric or symbolic expression newly computed (e.g. “DC = 24/5,” “x = (–b ± √(b²–4ac))/(2a)”).
* A new object or construction introduced (e.g. “Let D be the foot of the perpendicular from B to AC”).
* A relation or constraint established (e.g. “AB ⟂ DC,” “x ≠ 0,” “n is even”).
* A mini‐lemma or formula invocation (e.g. “Area(ΔABC) = ½·base·height,” “By Cauchy–Schwarz, …”).

**Do NOT** include:

* Justification or proof details beyond a very short phrase.
* Anything that isn’t a concrete fact used later.

**Example**
Problem:
In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $AC = 6$, and $\tan \angle BAC = -\tfrac{4}{3}$. Compute the area of $\triangle ABC$.

Step to analyze (Step t):
Now, let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. Then $\angle BDC = 90^\circ$. By projecting, we find $DC = \tfrac{24}{5}$.

Derived statement:

```
[
    "\(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AC\)",
    "\(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\)",
    "\(DC = \tfrac{24}{5}\)"
]
```
