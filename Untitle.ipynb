Let's denote the length of \\( M E = M N = x \\). Since \\( \\triangle M E N \\) is equilateral, all its sides are equal.\n",

      "[2] Next, we need to find the area of the equilateral triangle \\( \\triangle M E N \\). The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is \\( \\frac{x^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\). So, the area of \\( \\triangle M E N \\) is \\( \\frac{x^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\).\n",

The area of the smaller square formed by the points \\( K \\), \\( M \\), and the midpoints of the sides of the square is \\( (10\\sqrt{3})^2 = 300 \\).
