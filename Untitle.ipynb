      "As an expert reasoning graph architect, your task is to identify **direct dependencies** for **only the final step** in a given problem and solution by adhering to the following rules: **1. Direct Use Only**: Include a prior step in the final step's dependencies only if the final step explicitly relies on reasoning from that step, ignoring indirect dependencies. **2. Minimal & Non-Redundant**: If the final step depends on identical reasoning from multiple steps (e.g., the same lemma), include only the earliest step (smallest index), ensuring the set is the **minimal** required to justify the final step. **3. Output Format**: For the final step, identify any results, lemmas, or outputs from previous steps that inform its reasoning, marking them with `<expression>...</expression>` and specifying the source step with `<step>...</step>`. Provide a concise explanation of the final step's dependencies in a single short sentence. Do **not** include the results or outputs of the final step itself—only reference the dependencies from prior steps.\n",

      "[0] To determine all pairs of angles \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. First, consider the equation: \\[ \\log_2(\\sin x \\cos y) = -\\frac{3}{2} \\] This can be rewritten as: \\[ \\sin x \\cos y = 2^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\]\n",
      "[1] Next, consider the equation: \\[ \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\] This can be rewritten as: \\[ \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\]\n",
      "[2] Now we have a system of two equations: \\[ \\begin{cases} \\sin x \\cos y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\\\ \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y} = \\sqrt{2} \\end{cases} \\]\n",
      "[3] We can solve this system by eliminating \\(\\cos y\\). Multiply the first equation by \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}\\): \\[ \\sin x \\cos y \\cdot \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\] This simplifies to: \\[ \\sin^2 x = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n",
      "[4] Taking the square root of both sides, we get: \\[ \\sin x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n",
      "[5] Since \\(0^\\circ \\leq x < 180^\\circ\\), \\(\\sin x\\) is non-negative. Therefore: \\[ \\sin x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n",
      "[6] The angle \\(x\\) that satisfies this equation in the given range is: \\[ x = 45^\\circ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 135^\\circ \\]\n",
      "[7] Next, we substitute \\(\\sin x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) back into the second equation to find \\(\\cos y\\): \\[ \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\cos y} = \\sqrt{2} \\]\n",
      "[8] Solving for \\(\\cos y\\), we get: \\[ \\cos y = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n",
      "[9] The angle \\(y\\) that satisfies this equation in the given range is: \\[ y = 60^\\circ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = 300^\\circ \\]\n",
      "[10] However, since \\(0^\\circ \\leq y < 180^\\circ\\), we have: \\[ y = 60^\\circ \\]\n",
      "[11] Thus, the pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the system of equations are: \\[ (x, y) = (45^\\circ, 60^\\circ) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (135^\\circ, 60^\\circ) \\]\n",
      "[12] The final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{(45^\\circ, 60^\\circ), (135^\\circ, 60^\\circ)} \\]\n",
